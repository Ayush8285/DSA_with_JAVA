üîç Key Visual Concepts:
N-Queens: Place one queen per row, avoid column/diagonals
Sudoku: Try 1‚Äì9 per cell, move ahead only if valid
Subset Sum: Decision tree of pick/not pick
Word Search: Recursive DFS from each cell in 4 directions
Combination Sum: Try adding numbers recursively till target
Rat in Maze: Move in allowed directions, mark path
